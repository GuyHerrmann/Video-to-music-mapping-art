#video to music mapping project
The aim of this project is to produce a midi music file from a video whereby the video is mapped to the music, and the music will play with respect to what is on the video. 
This will be for a spesific video, which is outside the window of a train at night time videoing the lights that appear on a journey. 
The processed images will be in grayscale.
Image processing process:
Obtaining general information on frames : 
 - General distribution of colour (grayscale) in image
 - number of individual lights displayed
 - position and approximate size of each of these lights (x, y, size)
 - Other information to be explored at a further time
this should be written out in csv format for all the frames (on the same document)

This information will then be mapped to a midi output for a track that is made for the video. which is done by using these variable to control various aspects of a midi software.
